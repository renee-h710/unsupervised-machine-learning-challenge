# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

This excerise looks a unsupervised learning.

*Part 1: Prepare the Data*

*Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction*

  *The number of features decreased from 14 to 10*
  *There seems to be discernable clusters here.*
  
*Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means*

  Based on my above, I believe that the patients can be clustered into three distinct clusters.
